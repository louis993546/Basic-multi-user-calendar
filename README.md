#### How-to #1: Import project to GitHub
- Make sure you are not already in the folder you want to import
	* For example, you are in D:\GitHub\COMP3111, and the folder you want to import is D:\GitHub\COMP3111\calendar, this is fine
	* But, if you are in D:\GitHub\COMP3111\calendar and you want to import D:\GitHub\COMP3111\calendar, it won't work.
- "File" >> "Import" >> Search "Existing Projects into Workspace"
- Select that folder.
- Done
